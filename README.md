# march-machine-learning-mania

**Project Overview:**
As part of the Discovering America exchange program at Michigan State University (MSU), this project explores the application of machine learning in predicting NCAA College Basketball Tournament outcomes. The initiative, part of the 'March Machine Learning Mania 2024,' included a diverse team of undergraduate researchers from MSU and a cohort of students from China.

**Objectives:**
The primary goal was to predict team rankings and game outcomes with high accuracy for the upcoming NCAA tournaments, integrating historical game and team data.

**Techniques Used:**
We employed various machine learning algorithms including:
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
- Neural Networks

**Outcomes:**
The models demonstrated strong performance against historical benchmarks and provided valuable insights into key predictive factors, significantly enhancing the predictive accuracy of our analyses.

**Team Members:**
- Tarun Rawat
- Tri Duc Nguyen
- Xun Lu
- Elisha Alemao
- Guided by Chih-Li Sung

**Repository Contents:**
This GitHub repository contains all the code, datasets, and findings from our analysis. It serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding the methodology, implementation, and results of our project.
